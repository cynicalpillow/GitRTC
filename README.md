# GitRTC
Real time collaborative editor with syntax highlighting for various languages and Java compiler/runner. Features include real time editing across numerous clients through Differential Synchronization algorithm, enabling the workspace to include both local/collaborative files, creating/renaming/deleting collaborative files, adjustable window spacing within the editor, and syntax highlighting thanks to RSyntaxTextArea library components.
